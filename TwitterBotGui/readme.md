Second Alpha!
Added a function to maintain a list of favourite hashtags and easily use right click to copy.

You need the 3 .ps1 files in the same directory, then run "TwitterBotCommander.ps1"

You need to specify seperate source and destination folders

Images are resized and renamed (to remove spaces) when you click "generate"

The output folder will contain all your resized images and an image.js file to use with the twitter bot app.

You can apply tags and text on a per image basis, or to all images

Tags and settings can be saved / loaded

I welcome ideas, feedback, bugs etc.
