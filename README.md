Script for creating images.js for twitterbot

This script will prompt you for a directory with your images in, then prompt you for hashtags and any source attribution you want to use.
It will then parse the directory of images and create a images.js file for use with the twitter bot script
Twitter bot code can be found here https://gist.github.com/fourtonfish/58005106e1507369bbf0ed5f3e69b952
